I used the expo with react-native to implement this uber app.

Thus, you need to install the expo-cli first.

    1) npm install expo-cli -g

Then, you need to install the used modules by using npm.

    2) npm install

After installing the node modules, you can compile the app now.

To compile the react native project with expo, you need to sign up to the expo.

Link to the expo site: "https://expo.io"

If you don't want to sign up, then you could use this account:
    user_name: cs3301_p1
    password: helloworld123


Now, use the "expo build:android" command to build the app.

    3) expo build:android

//TODO
